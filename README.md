# This is DevOps repository only for Medial EarlySign

* In this repository we have the build process of [medpython](https://github.com/Medial-EarlySign/medpython) and push to PyPi.
    - It clones the [medpython](https://github.com/Medial-EarlySign/medpython) repository and also [MR_Tools](https://github.com/Medial-EarlySign/MR_Tools) (There are some pure python utilities that wewanted to wrap as a single library)
* We have here [dockers](Docker/medbuild_tools.new/) for compiling our source codes/installation examples.
