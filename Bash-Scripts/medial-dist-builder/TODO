  ---------------------------------------------
   Unable to find the LibSSH2 library on this
   system. Building a version without support
   for SSH transport.

   To build with SSH support, please install:
     libssh2-1-dev (package on e.g. Debian and Ubuntu)
     libssh2-devel (package on e.g. Fedora, CentOS and RHEL)
     libssh2 (Homebrew package on OS X)
   and try again.

   If the LibSSH2 library is installed on
   your system but the git2r configuration
   is unable to find it, you can specify
   the include and lib path to LibSSH2 with:
   R CMD INSTALL git2r --configure-vars='LIBS=-L/path/to/libs CPPFLAGS=-I/path/to/headers'
